Mappings for [STW Thesaurus for Economics](http://zbw.eu/stw)

## Scope

This repository aimes at covering mapping processes and code for STW. Currently it overlaps with the internal repository [thes](ite-git://gitlist/thes.git) and parts of the Github [sparql-queries](https://github.com/zbw/sparql-queries) repo.

## Language

While code and structural information will be in English, issues and discussion about particular terms will take place mostly in German, since that's the native language for the STW editorial team.

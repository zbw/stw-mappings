# stw-mappings
Mappings for [STW Thesaurus for Economics](http://zbw.eu/stw) (with an override mechanism for externally maintained mappings)

## Scope

This repository aimes at covering mapping processes and code for STW. Currently it overlaps with the internal repository ``thes`` and parts of the public [sparql-queries](https://github.com/zbw/sparql-queries) repo on Github.

## Mapping Targets

- __[Wikidata](var/wikidata)__
- __[GND](var/gnd)__
- __[DBpedia](var/dbpedia)__

## Language

While code and structural information will be in English, issues and discussion about particular terms will take place mostly in German, since that's the native language for members of the STW editorial team.
